553,553.1,"Lua is a robust, lightweight, and embeddable scripting language that supports multiple programming methods, including procedural, object-oriented, functional, and data-driven programming. As the primary focus on Lua is for scripting, it is rarely used as a standalone programming language. - As a popular component in video game and game engine development. For example, Warframe, World of Warcraft, and CRYENGINE all use Lua. - As a programming language in many network programs, like CISCO Systems, Nmap, and ModSecurity. - As a programming language in industrial programs such as Adobe Lightroom and MySQL Workbench. - As a library that developers can integrate with their programs to enable scripting functionality.",0,1.0,5.0,5.0,0.0,3.7802624702453613,3.7802624702453613,0.0,'space',16.375160217285156,16.375160217285156,0.0,'space',1.0280053615570068,1.0280053615570068,0.0,3.0,3.0,0.0,1.7596173286437988,1.7596173286437988,0.0,4.0,4.0,0.0,2.592496871948242,2.592496871948242,0.0,1.0

Many programmers praise lua's fast code, clean syntax, and ease of integration with C applications. It is fast, small, and can be easily embedded into games and applications. It's been used in several games including Heroes of Might and Magic V, SimCity 4, and World of Warcraft, and many more. It's also been used in applications including Adobe Photoshop Lightroom.

551,551.1,"Sure, here's a formal induction proof to show that $T(n)=O(n^3)$ using the Big O notation: Let $c = 15$ and $n_0 = 1$. Then, for all $n \ge n_0$ we have: $$T(n) = 15n^3 + n^2 + 4 \le 15n^3 + n^3 + n^3 = 31n^3.$$ Thus, we have $T(n) \le 31n^3$ for all $n \ge n_0$, and it follows that $T(n) = O(n^3)$. Here's how the above proof would look in LaTeX: Let $c = 15$ and $n_0 = 1$. Then, for all $n \ge n_0$, we have: $$T(n) = 15n^3 + n^2 + 4 \le 15n^3 + n^3 + n^3 = 31n^3.$$ Thus, we have $T(n) \le 31n^3$ for all $n \ge n_0$, and it follows that $T(n) = O(n^3)$.",0,1.0,,,,,,,,,1.0
